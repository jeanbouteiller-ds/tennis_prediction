# A Machine Learning approach of tennis gambling

## Project Description

We can summarize the project by mentionning the following main items: 
1. _Data Collection from different sources_: we are designing python jobs to run every day/week and collect relevant data directly on the ATP website. We create raw csv files that update every day/week.
2. _Data aggregation and cleaning_: we are cleaning the above mentioned data and merging them by identifying relevant unique keys. Python script are running in the backend. 
3. _Feature Engineering_: Using the dataset above mentioned, we can transform them to perform ML predictions and create relevant features
4. _Model deployment and testing_: using the features above mentioned, we want to develop ML models and test them live to measure performance.
5. _Design of a betting strategy_: using the odds of the model above, we will define a budget allocation strategy and apply it to future games. Betting is manual.
